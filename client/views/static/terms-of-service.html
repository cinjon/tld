#TIMELINED’S TERMS OF SERVICE

  *Effective Date:  April 15, 2014*

Timelined, LLC (“Timelined,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) owns and operates this website at timelined.com (“Website”). In order to use our Website, access the Timelines or any other content and services we may offer here (any of which, and all together, the “Services”), you (personally and, if applicable, on behalf of the entity for whom you are using the Website; collectively, “you”) must agree to and follow these Terms of Service (“Terms”) which constitute a legally binding agreement between Timelined and you.  By continuing to use our Services, you are agreeing to these Terms. The Terms apply whether or not you have registered for an account with us and they include our Privacy Policy and Infringement Policy.

BY ACCESSING OR USING ANY PART OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHICH CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WAIVER OF CLASS-ACTION RIGHTS, AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE SO BOUND, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE ANY SERVICES.

If you have any questions about these Terms, please email us at [support@timelined.com](mailto:support@timelined.com)

   1. Termination.  Timelined may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without any liability, modify, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Website, temporarily or permanently, at any time and without prior notice.  We may deny you access to all or part of the Website at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, if you engage in any conduct or activities that we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, violate these Terms, our rights or the rights of any third party) or no reason at all.

If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at [support@timelined.com](mailto:support@timelined.com), provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account) and allow 60 days to pass, during which we will attempt to reach an amicable settlement of any issue.  Disputes are further limited by the following:
   1. These Terms, your use of the Website and Services, and any other matter relating to Timelined will be governed by the laws of New York, without taking in to account any rules it has about how laws of another place might apply, unless U.S. Federal law applies.
   2. These Terms and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the United States Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings.  Any claims arising out of, relating to, or connected with these Terms must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including without limitation utilizing desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel).  The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  There are only two exceptions to this arbitration agreement:
      1. First, if we reasonably believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate these Terms, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      2. Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in New York, New York, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.
   1. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.
   2. REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE WEBSITE, SERVICES, OR THE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.
   1. Software made available through the Services may be subject to United States export control laws, which state that certain software cannot be downloaded to certain countries or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Deny Orders (and by using the Services you represent you are not on any of those lists).
   2. This Agreement makes up the entire agreement between the parties regarding Timelined, and supersedes any prior agreements.
   3. Under no circumstances shall Timelined or its licensors be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond Timelined’s reasonable control.
   4. When you use the Website or Services, or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on this Website or through the other Timelined Services. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. If you have a legal requirement to give communicate with or give notice to us, you must use the address [support@timelined.com](mailto:support@timelined.com).
   5. You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Timelined.  Timelined may freely do so, in whole or in part.  These Terms will be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of you and Timelined.  These Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights.  These Terms will be interpreted as if equally drafted by Timelined and you.  A party’s failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms will not waive its rights to exercise such right, power, or privilege in the future, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege, or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege under these Terms.  You and Timelined are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. The terms “includes” or “including” mean “includes, but is not limited to” and “including, but not limited to” respectively.
   6. If any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid or unenforceable, then such provision will be deemed automatically amended to the minimum extent necessary to conform to the requirements for validity as declared at such time and, as so adjusted, will be a legally binding provision of this Agreement as though originally included herein.  In the event that the provision invalidated is of such a nature that it cannot be so adjusted, the provision will be deemed deleted from this Agreement as though such provision had never been included herein.  In either case, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Also, the invalidity or unenforceability of any single part of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect.
