#Timelined Editor Guidelines

##Introduction

Timelined is an application designed to answer the who, what and when for audio and video. *Who said it? What did they say? When did they say it?* Our editors listen to audio or watch video, then break it down into smaller pieces called *highlights*. A collection of highlights make up the timeline for an episode.

##Your mission

As an editor, you'll create highlights based on the interesting discussions, stories, product recommendations, events, interviews and news you find in an episode. Our users should be able to quickly skim these notes and links to find what interests them. Think of the highlights you write as [Cliffs Notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CliffsNotes) for a particular piece of audio or video.

##Terminology

**Shows**

Shows are podcasts and videos. They're published regularly to places like iTunes or Youtube via feeds (a subscription protocol. Our software crawls these feeds looking for new instances of the show. When we find one, we put it into our database and prep it for editors.

Examples:

* [Podcast - The Joe Rogan Experience](http://joerogan.net/podcasts/)
* [Video - Foundation](http://foundation.bz)


**Episodes**

Episodes are instances of a show. As described above, we look for new episodes and get them ready for editors. New episodes make up the *queue*, which is where you'll find things to work on.

Example:

*[Daring Fireball Episode 79](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/79/)


**Highlights**

Highlights, which you'll be creating, are short summaries answering who, what and when for an episode.

A highlight can be one of four types: note, quote, link or sponsor. All highlights have a timestamp.

*Note* - a summary of what was said and who said it.

* *Tim explains his method for learning foreign languages.*
* *John remembers the time Steve Jobs yelled at him for criticizing the iPhone.*

*Quote* - a direct quote from a show host or guest.

* *Matt "I am convinced Ebay will acquire Square before the end of year."
* *Adam "I think the best health advice I can give a person is to get more sleep."

*Link* - a link is simply a link to and description of whatever is being discussed. Links can be anything but will frequently be to products,  audio or video, wikipedia pages and news items.

* LINK [Aeropress at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Aeropress-Coffee-and-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398910952&sr=8-1&keywords=aeropress)
* LINK [Elon Musk's Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)

*Sponsor* - a sponsor is when the host acknowledges the episode sponsor, typically via a brief advertisement or discussion about the sponsor.

* SPONSOR [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com)

##Getting Started

After you've created an account and completed the Editor Agreement, you can get started on a trial timeline. A trial is a practice run designed to help you learn the workflow and get feedback on your highlights. We'll provide instructions on how to get started with your trial, but it should mimic the process described in this document.


**The Queue**

The Queue is a list of unedited episodes waiting to be timelined. Click the [Queue link](http://timelined.com/queue) and you'll see the pending episode list, which will look like this:

![](/images/guidelines/queue.png)

You'll see the Show name and any pending episode titles. Click the Claim Episode button and you'll be the only person who can work on that episode. Click the Unclaim Episode button if you can't work on it anymore. Once you've claimed an episode, click the title to begin editing.

**The Editor**


The editor is where you'll be spending most of your time, so we hope you find it easy to work with. When you work with a new episode, you'll see something similar to this:

![](/images/guidelines/editor.png)

A few things to notice:

* The page is split into 2 panes. The darker pane will always contain the audio or video you're working with. The right pane is where you'll create highlights.
* Notice the Show title (Back to Work) in the top left and just beneath it the original Episode title (Back to Work 001).
* There are 3 buttons for adding a Host, Guest or Sponsor.
* The original show notes are beneath the player. These are notes provided by the content producer and might help you identify key topics, sponsors, hosts or guest. Show notes are not always provided.

##Workflow

**Pre-highlighting**

Before you start, it's best to review the show notes if they're available. Show notes can tell you who is on an episode and what it's about. If the show notes aren't available or offer little information, listen to the first minute or two of an episode to get a feel for it.

You're looking for few key pieces of info - the host(s), guest(s) and a sponsor. Before you can highlight, the People participating in the show must be idenitified. When you determine this information, click the button to add the host or guest.

* A Host is the regular show host. There can be multiple show hosts, but rarely are there more than 2. This information should be easy to figure out from the Show notes, first minute of play or previous episodes.
* A Guest is someone appearing for that particular episode. There can be multiple guests. This can be determined from the show notes, episode title or first minute of play.
* A Sponsor is the company sponsoring the episode, usually referenced by the show host early in the episode.


When you click the button to add a host or guest, start typing their full name. If they're in our database, a type-ahead box will appear and you can select their name. If they're not, enter their first name and last name (pay close attention to spelling) and hit return to add them. The process for adding a company is the same, but a company name can be any number of words.

**Highlighting**

Once you have an idea of hosts and guests, it's time to start highlighting. In the right pane, you'll see an empty highlight field:
